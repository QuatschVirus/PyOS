# PyOS

A lightweight kind of operating system that can be run in nothing more than a simple console window. It alone only has basic functions, but that's the point: You can customize it almost fully. You can write libraries or programs that can be run/used with it. They need a specific formatting, refer to the Guide on "How to write a Library/Program". Any help and ideas are welcome, just make a pull request. If you upload your own versions of this, please credit me. It's not needed per license, but i would very much appreciate it.

##Warning
This is NOT a standalone operating system or a virtual machine. It's just a funny little thing i programmed during an internet outage. It's not secure at all, and should not be used for important things.
