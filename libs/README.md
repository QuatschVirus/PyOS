# Libraries
Here you can find the newest versions of all working libraries that were submitted via pull request or directly created by a contributer. Refer to their documentation for detailed info on how to use these.

## What is a library?
Libraries implement new commands into the system to work with.

## I want to create my own library. How do i do that?
Libraries have some standardized formats and names for some objects. Use the `template.py` in here to get a view of it.
